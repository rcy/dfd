          DFD New Year's Day
        </h3>
        <p>
          Have your resolution for this year to be (a) present to
          yourself, to your joys and woes, to your sufferings and
          jubilations, loves and hates, ups and downs. Notice how it
          all flows. Changing, changing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need not anesthetize ourselves with constant distractions
          of shopping, consuming and discarding people and things to
          get us through the days, marathon watchings of videos,
          endless 'searching' on-line for anything to numb us from our
          discomfort of being alone. It is okay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Break through all of these, break free and truly enjoy life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experience yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please join and embrace the world revolution from
          within. Whether you are concerned about global climate
          change, or human rights and any good cause, all of them will
          be helped by having more and more people with calm and
          compassionate minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you allow yourself to experience sides of yourself,
          your shadow side, your anger, hatred...and not act on them,
          you will grow in self-acceptance, self love and from that
          will be borne compassion for all beings who are
          suffering. You will see people suffering, their addictions
          through the lens of 'yes that is in me too, I have
          experienced that, I have compassion for you and me, too!'
        </p>
        <p>
          Invite your friends and lets change the world one person,
          one moment at a time.
        </p>

          DFD Giftless Holiday Season
        </h3>
        <p>
          Every year our society goes wild over consumerism because
          that is how we are trained, inculcated from childhood. This
          needs to come to a close.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rampant consumerism has NOTHING to do with any of the
          traditional celebrations that occur at the end of the
          Western calendar year.
        </p>
        <p>
          So put a stop to all the destruction required for this
          consumerism, the stress, the addiction, the craving, the
          harm and let the Earth Breathe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Give the Earth something back for a change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Give Her the gift of a Giftless Holiday Season.
        </p>
